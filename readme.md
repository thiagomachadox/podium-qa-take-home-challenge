# Podium Demo Page Testing - Take Home Challenge

## Introduction

This project is part of the `QA Take Home Challenge` imposed by Podium as an application requirement for the Software Engineer in Test position.

Even though I've been working with Selenium/Pytest/Page Object Model for a long time, I decided to not use it in this project, since it'd be a little overkill and require too much setup upfront. For that reason, I decided to go with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) using [Custom Commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).

_The unfinished project using **POM/selenium/pytest** is located inside the `selenium` folder._
